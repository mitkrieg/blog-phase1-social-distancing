# Do we listen? A exploration of Social Distancing In NYC Parks

**Authors**: Mitch Krieger

## Overview

Using data from NYC Open Data Portal, mapped rates of Parks Patron's encounters with Social Distancing Ambassadors. Using Geopandas, folium and seaborn to generate visualizations, a blog about my findings can be found on medium.

## Next Steps

For further development of this project I would look into possible trends emerging from grouping the data by the different agencies Ambassadors come from, and take a closer look at smaller parks's individual data
